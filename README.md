# Fake-Virus-Prank-Script
This script is a harmless prank program that simulates a series of alarming virus infection messages. It creates multiple message boxes that appear to show virus detection, file deletion, and system hacking scenarios, but ultimately reveals it was just a prank.
Features

    Simulates virus detection alerts

    Mimics system error messages

    Creates fake file deletion notifications

    Pretends to show password theft and file transfers

    Ends with a reveal that it was just a prank

Warning

⚠️ This is a joke program only - it does not actually perform any malicious actions or harm your computer. It only displays message boxes.
How It Works

The script uses Visual Basic's MsgBox function to display a sequence of dialog boxes with different:

    Message texts (simulating virus activity)

    Icons (error, warning, information)

    Button combinations (OK, Cancel, Yes/No options)

Message Box Codes Explained

Each message box uses numeric codes to control its appearance:

    First number: Button type (0=OK, 1=OK/Cancel, etc.)

    Second number (after +): Icon style (16=Critical, 64=Information, etc.)

Usage

    Save the code with a .vbs extension (e.g., prank.vbs)

    Double-click to run (Windows only)

    The sequence of fake virus alerts will appear

Important Note

This is intended for harmless fun only. Do not use to actually deceive or scare people without immediately explaining it's a prank after execution.
Safety

The script:

    Does not modify any files

    Does not access the internet

    Does not collect any data

    Only displays message boxes
